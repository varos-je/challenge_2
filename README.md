# Challenge 2 - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
The following project is a web application for a personal portfolio that displays my previous work and projects. 

Should a future empoyer want to sample my previous work, then they can load my page and are then presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to navigate to other sections of my site, including "About me", "Work", and "Contact me" sections.

## Process
For this project, I contructed a base html document for the outline of the site. Then, I used css commands to color the page's text, as well as media queries to correct container sizing for mobile responsiveness. Additionally, I included a reset.css file, courtesy of John W. Comeau (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/).

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Visuals
I have included screenshots for my first three projects: challenge-1, hybrid-tracker, and Launchparty.
